# Experimental CSS in JS at compile time

Using macro concept by Parcel

## Why

Compile time computation is a advanced stage of two-stage programming, with regard to multi-stage programming (or partial evaluation). We can estimate Next.js SSG, SSR, React's RSC, and CSS in JS are all the same thing in terms of optimization. Thus what exactly we need here is only multi-stage programming concept for JS. It enables us to use the concept of delimited continuations, a.k.a. suspend / resume.
